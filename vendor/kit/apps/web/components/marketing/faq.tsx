    question: "What is AgentCN?",
    answer: [
      "AgentCN is an open source kit for adding AI agents to your app. Agents publish through a CLI and registry. You install the source into your repo and change behavior by editing code, not by flipping switches in someone else's dashboard.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "item-2",
    question: "Is it free to use?",
    answer: [
      "Yes. The core project is open source. Install agents into your repo, add your API keys, and ship them in your own product without paying AgentCN.",
      "If you want a full starter app with auth and a database, the AgentKit template is also open source on GitHub.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "item-3",
    question: "How much can I change?",
    answer: [
      "As much as you want. Each agent includes prompts, tools, schemas, and example usage. Because the code lives next to your app, changes go through the same review process as any other feature.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "item-4",
    question: "What stack does it use?",
    answer: [
      "TypeScript and the Vercel AI SDK. Agents install as editable source in your project. Connect Anthropic, Exa, Anchor, and other providers with your own API keys.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "item-5",
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: [
      "Open the docs, pick an agent from the registry, and run the install command shown on its page. Add your API keys to `.env.local`, wire the chat API route, and test in your app.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: "item-6",
    question: "Will more agents be added?",
    answer: [
      "Yes. The registry is meant to grow over time. New agents land with docs, install steps, and previews. You can suggest ideas or report gaps in GitHub discussions.",
    ],
  },
